## This key lime pie is half-baked :| ↓
### This is an early release. Expect bugs and glitches

# Keylang v0.0.1 (very early yes)

Keylang is a simple Python-like programming LANGuage that puts emphasis on built in functions and KEYwords.
It's quite similar to Python right now but it will evolve over time

***It's powered by Python, so you have to have that downloaded haha***
